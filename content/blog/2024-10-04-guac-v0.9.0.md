GUAC [v0.9.0](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.9.0) is now available.
*This release includes a compatibility-breaking change in the CLI introduced in v0.8.9.*

Version 0.9.0 improves performance of certifiers by not re-querying recently-updated packages.
The new `last-scan` option takes a numeric value in hours and will exclude packages that were updated within that time frame.
The `last-scan` defaults to 4.
Using a value of 0 will force the certifier to re-query all packages.

Version 0.8.9 introduced a compatibility-breaking change to the vulnerability query command line.
Commands now take the form `guacone query vuln <type> <input>` where *type* is one of "artifact", "purl", or "uri" and *input* is a corresponding string.
This enable support for searching for vulnerabilities via artifact.

In addition, the new releases include several smaller bug fixes.
See the [v0.8.9](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.8.9) and [v0.9.0](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.9.0) release pages for full details.
