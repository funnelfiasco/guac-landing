[GUAC v0.8.1](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.8.1) is now available.
This release contains a compatibility-breaking change to the database schemea.
It also includes several bug fixes and enhancements.

v0.8.1 makes a change in the update dependency schema to require dependencies be specified on a version, not just a package name.
This will break persistent installations of version 0.7.0 and earlier.
To upgrade to version v0.8.1, run the [migration script](https://github.com/pxp928/guac-update-db) *prior to upgrading GUAC*.

GUAC now returns `hasSBOM` and `hasSLSA` identifiers at ingenstion time.
This simplifies running subsequent queries or as a starting point for GUAC analysis.

This release also fixes bugs in some deps.dev queries and CycloneDX SBOM parsing. For a full list of changes, see the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.8.1).
