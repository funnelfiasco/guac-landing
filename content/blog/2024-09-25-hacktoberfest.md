This year marks the 11th edition of [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/), the annual event to celebrate and promote contribution to open source projects.
The GUAC project is participating with two of our repos: the [GUAC Docs](https://github.com/guacsec/guac-docs) and [GUAC Visualizer](https://github.com/guacsec/guac-visualizer).
You can find specifics about what we're looking for below, but all contributions are welcome.

To participate, [register on the Hacktoberfest website](https://hacktoberfest.com/register/).
If you have four pull requests merged to any participating repository in October, you get a digital badge from Hacktoberfest.
If you have any pull request merged to a GUAC repo, Kusari will send you some GUAC swag!

See the [contributing page](https://guac.sh/contributing) on the website and the README files in each repo for information on how to contribute to GUAC.
If you have any questions, [join us on Slack or in the GUAC Time office hours](https://guac.sh/community).

## GUAC Docs

The [guac-docs repo](https://github.com/guacsec/guac-docs) contains the source for the documentation and demos at [docs.guac.sh](https://docs.guac.sh).
We have good demos that show the basics of how GUAC works, but we need more reference material and explanations of how GUAC works.
The repo has a good set of [issues with suggestions](https://github.com/guacsec/guac-docs/issues), but we'd welcome any other improvements you can think of.
Even if you can't contribute the documentation, opening an issue in this repo for anything you find confusing or missing would be a big help, too.

## GUAC Visualizer

The experimental [GUAC Visualizer](https://github.com/guacsec/guac-visualizer/) is a way to visually display and explore the supply chain.
This repo isn't a core focus of the project, but it's an important part of demos and the onboarding experience.
We'd love to have your help improving this tool.
GUAC Visualizer is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application.
There are some [open issues](https://github.com/guacsec/guac-visualizer/issues) to work on, or you can bring your own ideas.
