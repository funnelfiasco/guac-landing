In the interests of a transparent open source community, the weekly GUAC Maintainer meetings are now public.
Join us on Mondays at [11 AM Eastern](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=NjBrdDZ0MzVsbTRiNjNqbGhpajVxMXQ0MGJfMjAyNDA2MDNUMTUwMDAwWiBzNjN2b2VmaHA1aTlwZmx0YjVxNjduZ3Blc0Bn&ctz=America/New_York).
The meeting is open to interested community members, but is primarily for maintainer discussion.
For general questions and discussion, join us in [#guac](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C03U677QD46) on the OpenSSF Slack.
