[GUAC v0.8.0](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.8.0) is now available.
This release brings support for license information, node deletion, and many other improvements.
You can now run vulnerability scans immediately on SBOM ingestion with the `--add-vuln-on-ingest` flag instead of waiting for the OSV certifier to run.
To better represent the real world, the `isDependency` relationship now only exists on package versions instead of the package name.
For a full list of changes, see the [release page on GitHub](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.8.0).

### License information support

GUAC v0.8.0 adds support for parsing license information provided in [CycloneDX SBOMs](https://cyclonedx.org/use-cases/#license-compliance).
The new release also includes a new experimental ClearlyDefined certifier.
GUAC will query the [ClearlyDefined license data store](https://clearlydefined.io/) to discover license information for packages, even when the SBOM does not include that information.

Although licenses don't directly impact security, they are an important part of understanding your software supply chain.
We're excited to expand GUAC's capabilities in this area.

### Node deletion

GUAC v0.8.0 adds support for deleting the following evidence nodes:  `certifyVuln`, `hasSBOM`, and `hasSLSA`.
This is helpful when SBOMs were ingested by accident or as part of a short-term demo.
`Delete` is supported in both the key value and the ENT backends.
If there are other nodes that you have a use case for deleting, please [file an issue](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=%5Bfeature%5D+FILL+THIS+IN) to let us know.
