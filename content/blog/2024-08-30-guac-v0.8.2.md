[GUAC v0.8.2](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.8.2) is now available.
This release contains improvements to queries and database migrations.

The [ClearlyDefined certifier](2024-08-01-clearlydefined.md) now batches queries in order to speed performance.
Calls to ClearlyDefined, OSV, and deps.dev are now rate-limited.
The limits follow the service provider's guidance.
Rate limiting ensures that GUAC users get full responses and prevents GUAC from overloading information providers.

Version 0.8.2 also includes an image for Atlas migrations.
This will enable seamless migrations to the Ent database layer when the schema changes across versions.
Users upgrading persistent installations of version 0.7.0 and earlier will still need to run the [migration script](https://github.com/pxp928/guac-update-db) prior to upgrading to version 0.8.0 and later.

The [GitHub release page](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.8.2) has a complete list of changes in this release.
