Calling all docs writers: we need *you*!
Good documentation makes all of the difference when trying out a new piece of software.
Supply chain security is important, so anything we can do to make GUAC easier to use helps us all.

## What we're looking for

We've made a start on [GUAC's documentation](https://docs.guac.sh), but we're not documentation experts.
You are.
We need your help to make the docs useful to people trying out GUAC or using it in production.

I opened some [issues in the guac-docs repo](https://github.com/guacsec/guac-docs/issues) to help get the process started.
This is not an exhaustive list, of course.
In fact, the issues that we *haven't* identified are the most valuable area for your expertise.

We'd love to have you stick around the community long-term, but you don't need to sign up for a long-term commitment.
One-time fixes of any size are welcome.
After all, incremental improvement is still improvement.

## About our docs

GUAC's documentation published to [docs.guac.sh](https://docs.guac.sh) from the [guacsec/guac-docs repo](https://github.com/guacsec/guac-docs) on GitHub.
The docs themselves are written in Markdown and rendered with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Just the Docs theme](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs).
Contributions to the GUAC documentation is governed by the [OpenSSF Code of Conduct](https://openssf.org/community/code-of-conduct).

If you see something on the main [GUAC website](https://guac.sh), we're happy to accept those reports and contributions, too.
See the [guacsec/guac-landing repo](https://github.com/guacsec/guac-landing) on GitHub.
