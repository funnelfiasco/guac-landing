[GUAC v0.8.4](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.8.4) is now available.
This is a bugfix release.
Astute readers will notice that there was no announcement for version 0.8.3.
Shortly after 0.8.3 was released, we received reports that the rate limit was not working correctly with the deps.dev service.
Version 0.8.4 fixes this on top of the other changes in the 0.8.3 release.

This release includes several fixes to SBOM parsing, including adding a documentRef attribute into client operations that reference hasSBOM and supporting the presence of multiple package URLs in SPDX SBOM externalRefs.
It also has database fixes to add a connection timeout and to enable successful altas migration when ENT auto migration was used to create the initial database.

The [GitHub release page](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.8.4) has a complete list of changes in this release.
