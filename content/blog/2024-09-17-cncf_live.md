Join members of the GUAC Community for another episode of [Cloud Native Live](https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-cncf-online-programs-presents-cloud-native-live-guac-use-cases-beyond-security/) on Tuesday, September 24.
In a [previous episode of Cloud Native Live](), we showed how GUAC can be used to locate and remediate vulnerabilities.
But fully understanding the software supply chain is more than just finding vulnerabilities.

In this session, you’ll learn about other insights that GUAC can help you discover from licenses to dependencies participating in Hacktoberfest.
Plus, you’ll see how GUAC can be used as an Kubernetes admission controller.

Join us for another fun session to taco'bout GUAC!
RSVP on the [event page](https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-cncf-online-programs-presents-cloud-native-live-guac-use-cases-beyond-security/) or catch the recording on the [CNCF YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@cncf).
