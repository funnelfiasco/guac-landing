The schedule for our regular GUAC Time office hours is changing.
In order to simplify the schedule, we'll start hosting GUAC Time at 11 AM Eastern on alternating Fridays.
The new schedule begins this coming Friday (30 August).
The [OpenSSF calendar](https://openssf.org/getinvolved) has the updated information.

We're making this change so that it's easier for everyone to remember when the office hours are.
We chose 11 AM Eastern becuase it keeps the meeting from being too early for community members on the west coast of the Americas and too late for those in Europe.

GUAC Time is an informal "office hours" setting where you can drop in to talk about what you're working on, ask questions, or have any other GUAC conversations.
Everyone is welcome to join, including and especially those who are new to GUAC or the software supply chain security space more generally.
We hope you'll join us!
