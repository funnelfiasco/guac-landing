The GUAC maintainers are happy to announce the [release of GUAC v0.7.0](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.7.0).
This release includes several pagination features in order to improve the performance of large result sets from queries.
Also new in v0.7.0, the collector supports reading from a directory inside an Amazon S3 bucket, in addition to the previously supported single file and whole-bucket reads.
We’ve improved the parsing of CycloneDX files to improve how transitive dependencies are represented.
And building off of the persistent backend added in v0.6.0, the new release adds support for automatic schema migrations.

As always, we thank the community members who contributed to this release.
We’d love to have *you* join the GUAC community.
