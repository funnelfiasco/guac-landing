GUAC [v0.10.0](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.10.0) is now available.
Version 0.10.0 contains several fixes, one of which makes a minor change to GraphQL queries.
Previously, a certifier query could hit PostreSQL's limit of 65535 parameters.
Now the `queryPackagesListForScan` query is split into two:
a listing of non-GUAC-type package IDs that require rescanning and a second query that gives the certifier a list of packages to scan.

This release also contains a fix from [Robbie Cronin](https://github.com/robert-cronin) for query failures in the key-value backend when a CertifyLegal node is empty.

See the [v0.10.0](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.10.0) release page for full details.
