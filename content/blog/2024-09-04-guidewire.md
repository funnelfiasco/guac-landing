Securing the software supply chain is paramount for the Guidewire Cloud Platform (GWCP).

GWCP uses GUAC to stay ahead of threats.

Anoop Gopalakrishnan, VP of Engineering at Guidewire, said:
> To us, the biggest value is GUAC's open nature and the community behind it.
> The advantage we see with GUAC is its flexibility and plugin architecture, which helps users achieve SLSA compliance at difference levels.
