If you'll be at [Open Source Summit Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/) in Vienna next week, be sure to catch these sessions.

I am a panelist on the "[Improving the Software Supply Chain](https://sched.co/1ej3E)" along with Tom Hennen from Google, Arnaud Le Hors from IBM, and Aeva Black from CISA.
We'll be discussing various projects under the OpenSSF and CNCF umbrellas, including GUAC, SLSA, and S2C2F.
We'll discuss what those names mean and how the open source communities behind them help improve software supply chain security.
Join us on Tuesday at 11:00 CEST in room 2.15.

As you roam the expo hall, stop by the OpenSSF booth between 1:30 and 2:30 PM Monday through Wednesday.
I'll be there to chat and give GUAC demos.
Stick around after Open Source Summit for the [OpenSSF Community Day](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/soss-community-day-europe/).
I hope to see you there!
