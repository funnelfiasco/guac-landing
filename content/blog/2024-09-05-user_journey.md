Software is only useful when people can use it.
We know GUAC is capable of addressing many problems people have securing their software supply chain, so we want to make sure it’s as usable as possible.
To do that, we want to talk to you.
We'd like to have a short call with you if you:

* Have read the GUAC landing page (guac.sh)
* Are NOT a current power user of GUAC
* Tried to go through some of the GUAC demos (optional)

We want to learn what you’re doing today to secure your software supply chain, what your pain points are, and how GUAC could help you address them.

If you’re willing to have a chat with us, email ben@kusari.dev.

If you’ve already tried GUAC and have feedback, please [let us know](https://guac.sh/community).
