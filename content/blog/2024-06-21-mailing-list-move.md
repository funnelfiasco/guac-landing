The GUAC mailing lists are moving from Google Groups to the OpenSSF list server.
Join [GUAC@lists.openssf.org](https://lists.openssf.org/g/GUAC) to continue receiving updates and participating in the conversation.
This list is open for all community discussion of GUAC.
The Google Groups list will enter read-only mode after the July 18 GUAC Community Meeting.

The GUAC maintainer list is also moving.
Use [GUAC-maintainers@lists.openssf.org](https://lists.openssf.org/g/GUAC-Maintainers) to report security issues or other confidential concerns to the maintainers.

We look forward to chatting with you on the [mailing list](https://lists.openssf.org/g/GUAC) and in [#GUAC on the OpenSSF Slack](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C03U677QD46).
